Problem statement : Real Estate Portal

● Property Listing and Search:
        o Users can post properties for sale with details
          like price, location, and contact information.
          
        o Property search functionality should allow
          users to filter properties based on area, BHK,
          location, amenities, and other criteria.

● Review System:
        o Users can post reviews of their dealing
          experiences with other users after a transaction.

        o Reviews help in verifying a seller's profile and
          past deal experiences, enabling users to make
          informed decisions before dealing with
          someone.

● Builder Login and Project Posting:
      o Builders should have a login to post new
        projects for users looking to buy new flats or
        offices.

      o The system should allow builders to showcase
        their projects and attract potential buyers.

Additionally , the advanced realiable real estate portal must
also present an option to give the user predictions of house
prices based on the various filters in the website , using
machine learning models and kaggle datasets of real world
data.
